* Delhi Metro Data Analysis Project *


📝 Project Overview
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Delhi Metro network. Using the delhi_metro_project.ipynb notebook, this analysis uses Python, Pandas, and data visualization libraries (like Matplotlib/Seaborn) to explore station data, line characteristics, interchange stations, and the overall network layout.

The notebook loads the initial data (delhi_metro_updated.csv), performs cleaning and feature engineering, and then uses the cleaned dataset (delhi_metro_cleaned_Dataset.csv) for analysis and visualization.
