🏙️ Delhi Metro Data Analysis Project
📘 Overview

This project analyzes Delhi Metro’s ridership, ticket usage, and revenue trends using Python-based data analytics.
The goal is to understand passenger behavior, identify busiest routes, and derive actionable insights to enhance operational efficiency and commuter satisfaction.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze ridership trends and ticket type distribution.

Identify top-performing stations and peak travel hours.

Study correlations between fare, distance, and revenue.

Visualize patterns to support data-driven decision-making.

Recommend improvements for frequency planning and digital ticketing.

💡 Key Insights

Smart Card users form the largest commuter base (~70%).

Tourist ticket usage peaks during weekends and festivals.

Rajiv Chowk and Kashmere Gate are major interchange hubs.

Revenue patterns show strong weekday consistency.

Fare is proportionally aligned with distance (linear pricing).

🧠 Recommendations

Increase train frequency during peak hours and festivals.

Implement AI-based crowd prediction models.

Promote mobile & QR-based ticketing for faster entry.

Offer off-peak discounts to balance passenger load.

Enhance tourist packages and improve station infrastructure.

🏁 Results

Generated comprehensive PDF Report and PowerPoint Presentation with visuals and insights.

Demonstrates the use of data visualization for urban transport optimization.

Project serves as a case study in data-driven infrastructure planning.
